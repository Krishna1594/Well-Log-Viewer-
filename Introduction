A service company has its own format of recording and storing data. The data is either stored in '.las' file format or '.xlsx','.xlsm' format. Sometimes companies also store the raw data in log-ASCII format but as a separate file for each loging tool or sonde. The data in the file can be in a structured manner or unstructured manner. Analyzing data recorded/stored in a structured manner is a bit easy as a trend can be deduced but not for the unstructured data. Identifying a trend and respective data is important.
