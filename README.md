# Well-Log-Viewer-
This repository contains various versions of the 'Well Log Viewer".  The intention of these tools is to utilize them in well-log interpretation and evaluation of formations quickly at the same time remembering the calculations, theory and pertinent assumptions behind the each tool. These are not just codes, this is my understanding of Petroleum/Petrophysics and a reminder that I am an engineer!

### Installation and Running the codes
Please note that the following codes are written in MATLAB (.m) files and can be loaded through matlab software installed in your computer.
### Usage
These can be used to generate well logs for various types of data storage formats and are strictly structural based record of the data in a log file. These codes can also be used to import, read, analyze and categorize the data depending on the type of data format (for example, for excel '.xlsx' and for text/ASCII files '.txt' or '.las'.) in any new tool. A very quick way and easy than searching for 'import' button.
### Introduction
he lack of a GitHub-Flavored Markdown table of contents marker seems to be a common complaint. It looks like there’s at least one automated option (DocToc), but I figured that I could learn something by working up a manual table of contents in Markdown.

I didn’t find a step-by-step guide, so I patched together one way to do it from various Markdown cheatsheets and StackOverflow posts. Here’s what I did.

Let’s get this out of the way…yes, manually creating a table of contents in Markdown is a pain. If you regularly add and delete sections in your README file, it’s even worse because you have to remember to update the table of contents too. The more headings your document has, the worse it gets. It’s not realistic to manually create tables of contents for every GitHub README file.

It does work, though. We will focus on that part for right now!
